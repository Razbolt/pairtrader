# Pair Trading Strategy Analysis - Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Rules & Governance
- This PRD is the **single source of truth** for requirements, specifications, and project direction.
- All implementation must be broken into **manageable phases** and documented here before coding.
- **Files must be modular** (max 500 lines per file) and organized in appropriate folders.
- **No changes** should be made to the codebase unless first reflected in this PRD.
- If user requests conflict with the PRD, update this document first.

## Project Overview
**Project Name:** Pair Trading Strategy Analysis with Raw vs Log Prices and Signal Optimization  
**Version:** 4.0  
**Last Updated:** June 2024
**Status:** ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS - Signal Optimization Phase

## Executive Summary
This project implements and analyzes pair trading strategies, with a new primary focus on **signal optimization using different methods** (machine learning, statistical, hybrid, etc.) and direct comparison with the classic cointegration approach. The goal is to identify the most robust and profitable signal generation methods for pair trading, using rigorous in-sample/out-sample testing and comprehensive performance metrics.

## Problem Statement
**Current Focus:**
- How can we optimize entry/exit signals for pair trading using advanced methods?
- How do these optimized signals compare to the classic cointegration strategy in terms of profitability, risk, and robustness?

## Key Findings (Previous Phases)
- Cointegration-based strategies are highly profitable when implemented with correct data handling and realistic thresholds.
- Data quality and parameter tuning are critical for success.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: âœ… Initial Implementation (Completed)
- Basic cointegration strategy, log returns vs raw prices, academic methodology, backtesting framework

### Phase 2: âœ… Comparative Analysis (Completed)
- Raw prices cointegration, multi-pair testing, statistical validation, z-score analysis

### Phase 3: âœ… Data Handling & Trading Logic Fixes (Completed)
- Data pipeline fixes, exit threshold bug fix, systematic re-testing, documentation

### Phase 4: âœ… Final Analysis (Completed)
- Comprehensive configuration testing, economic interpretation, practical viability

### Phase 5: ðŸš§ Signal Optimization & Comparative Analysis (IN PROGRESS)
- **Objective:** Optimize entry/exit signals for pair trading using various methods (ML, statistical, hybrid, etc.)
- **Tasks:**
  - Implement and test multiple signal optimization methods (e.g., ML classifiers, threshold search, hybrid)
  - Benchmark all methods against the classic cointegration strategy
  - Use in-sample/out-sample splits for robust evaluation
  - Compare performance: Sharpe ratio, win rate, P&L, trade frequency, robustness
  - Document findings and best practices
- **Expected Outcome:**
  - Identification of the most robust and profitable signal generation methods for pair trading
  - Clear comparison with the cointegration baseline

## Technical Implementation

### Data Pipeline
- `create_pair_trading_dataset.py` - Data preprocessing and split
- Consistent date handling, raw/log returns, quality validation

### Strategy Implementation
- `cointegration_strategy.py` - Cointegration-based strategy (baseline)
- `ml_pair_trading_strategy.py` - Machine learning and signal optimization
- `correlation_returns_strategy.py` - Correlation-based strategy

### Signal Optimization (New Focus)
- ML models: XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.
- Statistical threshold optimization
- Hybrid/ensemble approaches
- Feature engineering for signal quality

### Evaluation & Visualization
- In-sample/out-sample backtesting
- Performance metrics: Sharpe, win rate, P&L, trade frequency
- Visualization: trade signals, P&L, pair relationships

## Success Criteria
- **Technical:**
  - Multiple signal optimization methods implemented and tested
  - Robust comparison with cointegration baseline
  - Clear documentation of results and methodology
- **Academic:**
  - Proper methodology for signal optimization and evaluation
  - Transparent reporting of in-sample/out-sample results
- **Business:**
  - Actionable insights for robust pair trading signal generation
  - Framework ready for further research or production use

## Next Steps
- Complete implementation and testing of signal optimization methods
- Benchmark all methods against cointegration
- Update documentation and publish results
