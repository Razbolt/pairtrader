## Executive Summary
This project implements and analyzes pair trading strategies across multiple asset classes (stocks, commodities, crypto) with advanced signal optimization using machine learning, statistical methods, and unsupervised approaches. The framework provides comprehensive backtesting, visualization, and performance analysis tools for research and educational purposes.

## Problem Statement
**Current Focus:**

## XGBoost Regression Implementation

### How XGBoost Works for Pair Trading Signals
XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple weak learners (decision trees) to create a strong predictive model. In our pair trading context:

1. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Price spreads between pairs
   - Rolling statistics (mean, std, z-scores)
   - Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, moving averages)
   - Market regime indicators

2. **Target Variable:**
   - Binary classification: 1 for profitable trade opportunity, 0 otherwise
   - Regression: Direct prediction of expected return

3. **Training Process:**
   - Uses gradient boosting to minimize prediction errors
   - Handles overfitting through regularization
   - Provides feature importance rankings

4. **Signal Generation:**
   - Model predicts probability/return for each time period
   - Thresholds determine entry/exit signals
   - Ensemble predictions improve robustness

### Key Advantages
- **Non-linear Relationships:** Captures complex market dynamics
- **Feature Importance:** Identifies most predictive factors
- **Regularization:** Prevents overfitting to historical data
- **Handles Missing Data:** Robust to data quality issues
